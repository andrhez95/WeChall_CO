I have written another include system for my dynamic webpages, but it seems to be vulnerable to LFI.
Here is the code:


GeSHi`ed PHP c√≥digo
<?php
if (isset($_GET['which']))
{
        $which = $_GET['which'];
        switch ($which)
        {
        case 0:
        case 1:
        case 2:
                require_once $which.'.php';
                break;
        default:
                echo GWF_HTML::error('PHP-0817', 'Hacker NoNoNo!', false);
                break;
        }
}
?>
